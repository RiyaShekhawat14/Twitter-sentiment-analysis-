# 🐦 Twitter Sentiment Analysis using Logistic Regression

This project is a **Machine Learning–based Twitter Sentiment Analysis system** that classifies tweets as **Positive** or **Negative** using the **Logistic Regression** algorithm.  
The model is trained on labeled tweet data and predicts sentiment for unseen tweets.

## 📌 Project Overview

Social media platforms like Twitter generate massive amounts of textual data every day.  
Understanding public sentiment from this data is important for:
- Brand analysis
- Public opinion monitoring
- Customer feedback analysis

This project uses **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques and **Logistic Regression** to analyze tweet sentiments.

## 🎯 Objective

- To preprocess raw tweet text
- To train a **Logistic Regression classifier**
- To classify tweets into **Positive** or **Negative** sentiment
- To evaluate model performance using test data

## 🧠 Machine Learning Algorithm Used

### Logistic Regression
- Supervised learning algorithm
- Used for **binary classification**
- Uses the **sigmoid function** to predict probabilities
- Efficient and interpretable for text classification problems

## 🛠️ Technologies & Tools Used

- **Python**
- **NumPy**
- **Pandas**
- **Scikit-learn**
- **NLTK**
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn**
- **Jupyter Notebook / VS Code**
- **Git & GitHub**

## 📂 Dataset

- Dataset consists of labeled tweets:
  - `1` → Positive sentiment
  - `0` → Negative sentiment
- Data is split into **training** and **testing** sets

> ⚠️ Note: Dataset is not uploaded due to size limitations.  
> Dataset source can be added here (e.g., Kaggle link).
